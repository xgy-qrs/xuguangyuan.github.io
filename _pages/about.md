## 📖 Biography

I am currently a Master's student (2024–Present) majoring in **Photoelectric Information Engineering** at the **University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)** and the **Hangzhou Institute for Advanced Study (HIAS)**. I conduct my research at the **Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics (SIOM)** in the **Computational Optical Imaging Group**, under the supervision of **Prof. Guohai Situ**.

My research interests lie at the intersection of optics and computer science, specifically in **Computational Imaging**. I aim to solve inverse problems in imaging systems to achieve visibility in extreme environments. My current work focuses on:

* **Scattering Imaging:** Reconstructing objects through strong scattering media (e.g., imaging through smoke and flames in fire scenarios) and dynamic scattering environments (e.g., deep-sea optical exploration).
* **Single-Pixel Imaging (SPI):** Develop a rotating disc modulation device with servo function to achieve high-speed SPI system.

I approach these problems by combining **physical modeling** (imaging mechanisms & simulation) with advanced optimization techniques, including **Deep Learning (DL)** and precise hardware **servo control**.
